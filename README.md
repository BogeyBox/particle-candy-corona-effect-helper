# Installation

1.  Copy lib_particle_candy.lua file to this project

# Usage

Use sliders in Settings tab to adjust Particle Type Properties and Emitter settings.
Switch to tab Test to view your settings in action.
Every time you switch to tab Test your settings will be printed in console.
If you want to adjust default settings you can edit Properties table [default key] in main.lua file.

# Limitations

For now only simple Particle Type properties are adjustable. If you want something more you can raise a feature request [or pull request :) ].
